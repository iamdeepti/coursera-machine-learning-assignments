![](machinelearning.jpg)

This repositry contains the solutions (from ex3 and onwards, solutions for ex1 and ex2 are in matlab) to python versions of the programming assignments for the [Machine Learning online class](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) taught by Professor Andrew Ng. 
    This sub directory (i.e.ml-coursera-python-assignments-master) was first cloned from the repository https://github.com/dibgerge/ml-coursera-python-assignments which provides a good python version of the assignments in the course.
